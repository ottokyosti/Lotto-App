# The Lotto-App
## Overview
This project's goal was to develop an application that acts as a Lotto machine. The user inputs seven different numbers and the application draws seven different numbers of its own. It then compares those numbers to user's numbers and draws new seven numbers until it gets seven right. In the end the application outputs how many years did it took to guess 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. right. If it takes more than a lifetime (120 years), the application loops. The application will end when it guesses seven numbers right within (120x52=)6240 guesses. The user can also decides if he/she wants to see the lotto numbers as the application guesses them.
